#+title: Intro to Cloud and Open Stack

* Cloud/Cloud Computing :
- Delivery of computing resources- platform , application to the datacenters
  on demand as pay per basis over the internet.
- Instead of owning the private servers companies can rent cloud servers to host
  their various services.
- makes business scalalble, effiecient, and reliable.

** Public Cloud :
- Instead of storing the data and processing them in your local desktop machine
  you hire a company provide comuting power and   store data on their powerful
  servers and access via the web .
- This scheme of operation is of public cloud.


** Private Cloud:
- Instead of having the computation and storage on the employee desk companies
  buy big servers where all computation and storage is handled .

** Hybrid Cloud:
- partly public partly private
-

** Cloud Service Models:

*** Infrastructure as service:
- Here cloud provider provides servers, storage, network interfaces, firewalls
  as service to the user.
- Servers can be collection of VM or physical computers
- Databases stored as block or object storage and  can be accessed directly
  or via network drive  or as object via web interface.
- firewalls for protection of infrastructure is provided.
- User provides OS image and the application software .
- User is responsible to main the OS and their softwares
- Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

*** Platform as service:
- Cloud service provider provides for complete computing platform along with un
  derlying hardware, server,Database ( block or object) , firewalls, network interface
  and also OS image. The platform is use ready for the User.
- User are to provide for the Application software and also responsible to
  maintain the application software.
- Provider is reponsible to main the platform that includes maintaince of servers,
  database, maintaining firewalls, also updating the OS Images.
- Examples: Amazon Web Services, Google App Engine , Elastic , Beanstalk

*** Software as Service:
- Cloud Service Provider provides the hardware infrastructure, server, database,
   ,underlying OS along with the Application installedin it . It is ready to use
  for the user.
- The role of the user is to use th application out of the box.
- Generally software is not bought but rented.
- Maintainence of platform and software fall under the responsibility of cloud
  provider.
- Example :
  1. Dropbox
  2. Microsoft Office 365


*** Intermediate Cloud Offerring:
- Provider which provides SaaS  PaaS ans IaaS operation as servicew offering
- Salesforce provides platform for developers to add on the main applications
  and also salesforce as software offerring.
- Microsoft Azure provides both IAAS ans PAAS as offerring.

*** Why Cloud ? Why not Cloud ?
1. Is cloud necessary ?
2. Is it better to stay unclouded ?
3. Is it viable to maintain private cloud ?
4. Should tranfer to public cloud ?

*** Scenarios :
- Public Cloud Advantages :
  - at starting of the business its always better to use public cloud , if a platform
    requires cloud services
  - if a platform requires than public cloud is better choice as it becomes easy to
    scale, system is more reliable , no other maintainence, no additional staff
    , no extra financial burden to develop own facility buy servers.
  - Also more security in public cloud , bugs  and vulnerability are identified
    and patche applied periodically, physically more secured, backups at multiple
    locations , easy to scale at a click of a button .
  - proper security check for the cloud admins.
  - Security Assestment and certifications.
  - regulations of government.


- Private Cloud Advantage:
  - if business is big enough then it is better to host on private cloud:
  - better end to end control
  - more realiable
  - efficient systems
  - less cost on long runs.
  - improved user experience.

- Cons of Public Cloud :
  - Application may not require thee scalable.
  - May be difficult  require or organize the application to make it ready for
    the cloud
  - Even if it is possible to transfer it may not be viable as cost wise, maybe
    significant cost.
  - Security is under the cloud responsibility which my be a risk for your
    application.
  - Data may being mined
  - Security admin may not be trusted.
  - Physical location of data storage may be in foreign countries ( may not be
    firendly to own country).
  - How can it be ensured that deleted is always deleted ?
  - Data breach notification ?

*** Cloud Providers:
- Amazon Web Services
- Microsoft Azure
- Verizon Terremark
- Google Compute Engine

*** Docker Container :
- A docker is different from the virtual machine that it doesnot contain a
  operating system
