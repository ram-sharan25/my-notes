- About the error of turf

- This was warning indicating that source map file for minified JS was missing for turf

- It could be resolved by asking the webpack to ignore the missing source map of turf
  But we are using create-react-app , and it had to be overridden with react-app-rewired , so that
  the webpack config will ignore that missing source map file

- It could also be resolved by adding GENERATE_SOURCEMAP = false in env file
  which will disable to generate any source map
