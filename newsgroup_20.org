** Loading and Exploring the data
- First load the data.
- Here the sklearn has the data and it is imported.
- Get the training data from the dataset
- As we are only doing a two class classification we are
  aggregating the classes  into two classes so that several
  label are organized in a two classes.
- Label generation for the training purpose( new label
  as a two class )

** Text Preprocessing
*** lowercasing
- converting all the data to the lower case so that
   texts that differ only in the casing are taken as same

*** Removing the punctuation and special characters
Remove the punctuation and the special characters that doesnot
carry semantic meaning.
*** Tokenization
split the text into individual words( tokens)
*** Removing Stop Words
remove the most common words that doesnot contirbute
any information in the text
*** Lemmatization or stemming
convert the word to their base form . It will retain the
context of the text .
**  Feature Extraction ( Vectorization )
*** Bag of words
*** Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency ( TF-IDF)

** Splitting the Dataset

** Model Training

** Logistic Regression

** Model Evaluation
